Dear all,

I am really happy to present you a complete re-writting of the FAM-N optimisation program, featuring:

- Modular and object-oriented Python 3.7.3 package with highly improved readebility.
- Significantly faster execution for long pulses, no calculation is repeated.
- Native integration of complex FAM-N pulses - succession/concatenation etc.
- Instance manager. No need to repeat optimisations.
- End-user oriented GUI. Advanced execution - i.e. loops on parameters, re-optimisations etc. - possible via console mode.

As it is the first version, it probably have bugs everywhere please feel free to report me any bug you may encounter.

Best,

Henri
