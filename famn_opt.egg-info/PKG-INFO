Description: FAM-N (Fast Amplitude Modulation - N pulses) is a composite pulse that
        exploits the phenomenon of inversion/saturation of satellite transtion into the central
        transition to enhance the efficiency of the conversion pulse in MQMAS
        experiments, improving the overall sensitivity of the experiment.
        This program determines the number of individual pulse and their
        respective durations required for an optimal conversion under the
        experimental conditions defined by the user.
